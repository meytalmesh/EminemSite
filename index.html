<h2>About EMINEM</h2>
<br/>

<font size="4.5">

<B>Marshall Bruce Mathers III</B> - born October 17, 1972<br/> 
known professionally as Eminem, is an American rapper, songwriter, record producer, record executive, film producer, and actor.<br/>
He is consistently cited as one of the greatest and most influential artists of all time in hip hop,<br/>
 with Rolling Stone placing him in its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and labeling him the "King of Hip Hop".<br/>
After his debut album Infinite (1996) and the extended play Slim Shady EP (1997),<br/>
Eminem signed with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP,<br/>
which earned him his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album.<br/>
His next two releases, 2000's The Marshall Mathers LP and 2002's The Eminem Show, were worldwide successes, with each being certified diamond in U.S.<br/>
sales and both winning Best Rap Album Grammy Awards—making Eminem the first artist to win the award for three consecutive LPs.<br/>
They were followed by Encore in 2004, another critical and commercial success. Eminem went on hiatus after touring in 2005 partly due to a prescription drug addiction.<br/>
He released Relapse in 2009 and Recovery in 2010. Both won Grammy Awards and Recovery was the best-selling album of 2010 worldwide, the second time he had the international<br/>
best-selling album of the year (after The Eminem Show). Eminem's eighth album, 2013's The Marshall Mathers LP 2, won two Grammy Awards, including Best Rap Album; it expanded<br/>
his record for the most wins in that category and his Grammy total to 15.<br/>
These were followed by 2017's Revival and 2018's Kamikaze. the latter being the best-selling hip hop album of 2018.<br/>

<br/>

<b>3 main differences:</b>
<br/>
<br/>
1. Web 1.0 <br/>
Web 1.0 refers to the first stage of the World Wide Web evolution.
In Web 1.0 advertisements on websites while surfing the internet is banned.
Also, in Web 1.0, Ofoto is an online digital photography website, on which user could store, share, view and print digital pictures.
It is the “readable” phrase of the World Wide Web with flat data.
In Web 1.0, there is only limited interaction between sites and web users. 
Web 1.0 is simply an information portal where users passively receive information without being given the opportunity to post reviews, comments, and feedback.
Static pages. Content is served from the server’s file-system.

<br/>
<br/>
2. Web 2.0 <br/>
Web 2.0 refers to world wide website which highlight user-generated content,<br/>
usability and interoperability for end users.<br/>
It is the “writable” phrase of the World Wide Web with interactive data. Unlike Web 1.0, Web 2.0 facilitates interaction between web users and sites, <br/>
so it allows users to interact more freely with each other. Web 2.0 encourages participation, collaboration, and information sharing. <br/>
A major difference is now Information flows between site owner and
site users by means of evaluation & online commenting.
As such, the end user is not only a user of the application but also a participant.
Examples of Web 2.0 applications are Youtube, Wiki, Flickr, Facebook, and so on.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
3. Web 3.0 <br/>
It refers the evolution of web utilization and interaction which includes altering the Web into a database.<br/>
It is the “executable” phrase of Word Wide Web with dynamic applications, interactive services, and “machine-to-machine” interaction.<br/> 
Web 3.0 is a semantic web which refers to the future. In Web 3.0, computers can interpret information like humans and intelligently generate <br/>
and distribute useful content tailored to the needs of users. One example of Web 3.0 is Tivo, a digital video recorder. Its recording program <br/>
can search the web and read what it finds to you based on your preferences.
A major difference is Semantic Web.<br />
The succeeding evolution of the Web involves the Semantic Web.<br />
The semantic web improves web technologies in demand to create, share and connect content through<br />
    search and analysis based on the capability to comprehend the meaning of words, rather than on keywords or numbers.
<br/>
<br/>
Examle: For the query: "Eminem" <br/>
Web 1.0 will give a static results. <br/>
Web 2.0 will give a interactive results such as Eminem's Facebook page. <br/>
Web 3.0 will give a dynamic results, <br />
which based on the wisdom of the crowd, for example the last information the user was looking for about the artist. <br />
I will get interactive pages that have a lot of posts with a query like mine -<br />
those pages contain database based on more than trillion user posts with a query like mine or queries in the same topic.<br />
